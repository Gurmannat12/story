son to buy anything. child was very sad. after some time the child lost the 
contact with his parents as there were many visitors in the exhibition.

now only wants his parents but not those gifts.The main point in the story is at
 the end of the day nothing is more important than your parents. so always make 
 sure you respect them and love them infinitely.
